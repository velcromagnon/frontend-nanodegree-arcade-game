## Background
This game is derived from an old arcade game called Frogger.

## Instructions

Your objective is to move your character up the screen to the water without being hit by the enemies. There are two game modes, standard and scoring.
Pressing H or ? will give you help on all key commands in the game.

## Standard
Once you reach the top, you have won the game, and if any enemy hits you, you have lost. A count
of the number of times you have won is shown at the bottom of the screen.

## Scoring
In this mode, you start with three lives, and your object is to score the most points possible.
This mode is unlocked by winning 25 times in standard mode.
Along the way, you may encounter boulders that are impassable, and powerups that give you either
additional points or health. At each level, the enemies may become faster and more numerous, and
less predictable as well.
